# 🌐 FoodFire Server

A FoodFire Server (Node.js web server) that fetches data from a third-party (Swiggy) API (Fix the CORS Issue) and exposes it to a client [🚀 FoodFire ](https://foodfire-app.netlify.app/) App 😍.

🍁 [FoodFire App](https://foodfire-app.netlify.app/) is part of [Namaste React Live Course](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-react?_aff=946684804112) and Github Repository for this App is [Namaste-React 💜](https://github.com/chetannada/Namaste-React) ️
<br/>

```

Go to the project directory

  cd FoodFire-Server
```

Install dependencies

```

Start the server

```

This application should now be running on `localhost`. If you want to Fork repository and want to run locally, follow this guidelines [Fork and Clone Github Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

💫 Test the FoodFire Server Locally in your FoodFire React App then use this domain name (`http://localhost:5000/`) if the Server is running on a `5000` Port:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:5000/api/restaurants?lat=12.9351929&lng=77.62448069999999&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING`
);

const data = await response.json();
```

## 🔮 Deploy the FoodFire server

Once you have tested the FoodFire server locally, you can deploy it to a production environment by following these steps.

1. Create an account on [Render](https://render.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Click on the `New +` button and select `Web Service` from the dropdown menu.
3. `Connect` to your own GitHub repository (node server that you have created your own) which you want to deploy.
4. In the `Settings` tab, scroll down to the `Environment Variables` section and add all environment variables from `.env` file.
5. Wait for the deployment to finish. Once it's done, you should see a success message and a link to our server URL. For Instance: `http://YourOwnServerName.onrender.com`
6. Click on the link URL to test our server.

Note: Now that our server is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) you can change the API URL in react app to the domain in which the server is deployed. For instance: if your server is hosted in `http://YourOwnServerName.onrender.com`, in the react app while sending a request to API, use this domain name :

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  `http://YourOwnServerName.onrender.com/api/restaurants?lat=12.9351929&lng=77.62448069999999&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING`
);
```
